known issues:

- icons in welcome message are absurd
- anyone can access admin panel
- ui is ugly/confusing
- top movies in theaters don't go to anything / needs api
- imdb page doesn't have 250 movies, only top 10.
- imdb top 250 doesn't format apostrophes correctly
- triggers/categories are generic, this is to avoid having to read difficult things repeatedly while programming the app.
